  The name Plumbline comes from the standard of being balanced in the Word of
  God and the power of the Holy Spirit. Our desire is to see Ephesians 4:12
  fulfilled by "equipping the saints for the work of the ministry.” We do this
  by revealing the Father’s heart through the power of the Holy Spirit for the
  glory of Jesus Christ.  Plumbline Ministries began in 1990 and has had many
  experiences with many denominations in the United States and other countries. 
  Plumbline’s Training Mandates:  • Advancing the Kingdom  • Awakening the
  Kingdom  • Your Destiny in the Kingdom  • Healing  • Spiritual Gifts  •
  Equipping in the Prophetic  • Training in Prayer and Intercession  •
  Discipleship  You can click the link below and go to Plumbline's website.
